Pseudostipules absent to minute and scale-like to 1 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 1-3.5 cm, often near the base of the plant but sometimes in the distal half of the plant, generally unforked, with 1-5 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; peduncle highly contracted, sessile to 0.1 cm long, but sometimes longer to 1.8 cm long; pedicels 10-45 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated high in the distal half.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous.

Corollas 2.8-3.2 cm in diameter, rotate, acumens 3-4 mm long, edges of corolla flat, not folded dorsally, white to dark violet above and below. Anthers 6-8 mm long, connate, yellow, apically poricidally dehiscent and often maturing to a short introrse apical slit, filaments 1-4 mm long. Ovary with style 8-9 mm long, exceeding stamens by 1-3 mm, straight, with stigma globose.Fruits 1-2 cm in diameter, globose, medium green throughout.Seeds generally not present, but the rare seeds produced are green-white throughout, ovoid, ca. 2 mm long, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet. Removal of these hair-like lateral walls by enzyme digestion reveals a honeycomb pattern at their base.",

Leaves odd-pinnate, 7-11.5 cm long, 4.5-8 cm wide, puberulent adaxially and abaxially; petioles 1-2.7 cm long; lateral leaflet pairs 2-3, the size of the lateral leaflets gradually diminishing gradually towards the base of the leaf; most distal lateral leaflets 3.5-6 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide, elliptic to elliptic-lanceolate, apex obtuse, acute to acuminate, base oblique, sessile; terminal leaflet 4-7.5 cm long, 1-2 cm wide, lanceolate, apex acute, base attenuate; interjected leaflets absent.Inflorescence a dichasially branched, ebracteate, monochasial or dichasial cyme, 2-3 forked, generally in the distal half of the plant, with 2-10 flowers, all flowers perfect, peduncle 1-3.2 cm long; pedicels 10-20 mm long, articulate between the proximal \u00bc and the distal \u00bc.Flowers with the calyx 5.5-7 mm long, lobes elliptic, apiculate, acumens 1-3 mm long. Corollas 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter, stellate, without acumens, edges of corolla flat, not folded dorsally, white. Anthers 5-6 mm long, connate, yellow, apically poricidally dehiscent and often maturing to a short introrse apical slit, filaments 1-4 mm long. Ovary with style 9-12 mm long, exceeding stamens by 3 mm, straight, with stigma globose.Fruits 1 cm in diameter, globose, green throughout.Seeds from living specimens often absent, if present green-white throughout, ovoid, ca. 2 mm long, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet. Removal of these hair-like lateral walls by enzyme digestion reveals a honeycomb pattern at their base.",
