Pedicels at anthesis deflexed, 1-1.4 cm long, tapering from the calyx tube to a slender base ca. 0.5 mm in diam.Flowers with the calyx tube 1-1.5 mm long, the lobes long-triangular to deltoid, 0.5-3 mm long, glabrous, the margins of the sinuses white and thickened; corolla white, ca. 1.8 cm in diam., lobed nearly to the base, the lobes reflexed at anthesis, the tips and backs of the lobes minutely papillose; anthers 3-4 x ca. 1.5 mm, poricidal at the tips, the pores tear-drop shaped; free portion of the filaments ca. 0.25 mm long, the filament tube ca. 0.5 mm long; ovary glabrous; style straight, slightly clavate, ca. 7 mm long; stigma a minutely papillose area on the tip of the club.Fruit a globose, green berry, umbonate when immature, 1.1-1.8 cm in diam.; fruiting pedicels woody, erect, 1.8-2.3 cm, 0.75-1 mm in diam. at the base; calyx lobes erect and woody in fruit, 3-4 mm long.Seeds unknown.", "char_json": [{"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "shrub or small tree"}, {"characteristic": "life history", "value": "perennial"}, {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "2-4 m"}, {"characteristic": "stem surface texture", "value": "minutely rusty-papillose"}, {"characteristic": "stem surface texture (older stems)", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "bark color", "value": "grey"}, {"characteristic": "bark surface texture", "value": "large white-lenticellate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf arrangement", "value": "strongly anisophyllous"}, {"characteristic": "leaf shape", "value": "elliptic"}, {"characteristic": "leaf width", "value": "4.6-9.3 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf length", "value": "12.6-20.8 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf surface texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "petiole length", "value": "0.9-2 cm"}, {"characteristic": "petiole surface texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf shape", "value": "orbicular"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf width", "value": "1.9-4.1 cm"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf length", "value": "2-5 cm"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence shape", "value": "simple"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence position", "value": "opposite the leaves"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence length", "value": "0.3-1.5 cm"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence flower number", "value": "5-20-flowered"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel length", "value": "1-1.4 cm"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel spacing", "value": "ca. 0.5 mm apart"}, {"characteristic": "bud shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "bud surface texture", "value": "rusty-papillose"}, {"characteristic": "calyx tube length", "value": "1-1.5 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx lobe shape", "value": "long-acuminate"}, {"characteristic": "corolla diameter", "value": "ca. 1.8 cm"}, {"characteristic": "corolla shape", "value": "lobed nearly to the base"}, {"characteristic": "corolla color", "value": "white"}, {"characteristic": "corolla surface texture", "value": "minutely papillose"}, {"characteristic": "anther length", "value": "3-4 x ca. 1.5 mm"}, {"characteristic": "anther shape", "value": "tear-drop shaped"}, {"characteristic": "filament length", "value": "ca. 0.25 mm"}, {"characteristic": "filament tube length", "value": "ca. 0.5 mm"}, {"characteristic": "ovary shape", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "style length", "value": "ca. 7 mm"}, {"characteristic": "stigma shape", "value": "a minutely papillose area"}, {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "globose"}, {"characteristic": "fruit color", "value": "green"}, {"characteristic": "fruit surface texture", "value": "umbonate when immature"}, {"characteristic": "fruiting pedicel length", "value": "1.8-2.3 cm"}, {"characteristic": "fruiting pedicel diameter", "value": "0.75-1 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx lobe length", "value": "3-4 mm"}, {"characteristic": "seed shape", "value": "unknown"}], "failed_str": null}]}
