Pseudostipules absent or up to 10 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 3-10 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 13-21 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; peduncle 4-19 cm long; pedicels 1.3-2.1 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated at about the middle.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 6-7 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 4-6 mm, long attenuate, the acumens ca. 2.3 mm long, with hairs like those of the stem.
