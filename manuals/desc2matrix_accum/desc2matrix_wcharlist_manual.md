# desc2matrix_wcharlist.py user manual

This document explains the up-to-date manual for using `desc2matrix_wcharlist.py`, which converts the description text files generated by the `Makefile` into a structured JSON output containing the traits and corresponding values. The difference between `desc2matrix_py` and this script is that this includes a pre-determined list of traits in the prompt so that model outputs are more or less standardised across species.

## Operation

1. Retrieve the initial list of traits from the charlistfile

2. Retrieve traits from the rest of the species using the list of trait names

The names of traits are fed into the LLM run extracting the traits of the subsequent species. The model is asked to extract the given list of traits, put 'NA' where a given trait is missing in the description, and add any traits that are not in the list but are mentioned in the species description.

## Default prompts

The default prompts are hard-coded in `common_scripts/default_prompts.py`, but can be imported from a text file using the relevant options (see **Arguments**). The prompt must include the following special 'markers':

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[DESCRIPTION]` | Plant description text to compile |
| `[CHARACTER_LIST]` | Given list of traits to extract |

### System prompt

<pre>
You are a diligent robot assistant made by a botanist. You have expert knowledge of botanical terminology.
Your goal is to transcribe the given botanical description of plant characteristics into a valid JSON output.
Your answer must be as complete and accurate as possible.
You must answer in valid JSON, with no other text.
</pre>

### Prompt

<pre>
You are given a botanical description of a plant species taken from published floras.
You extract the types of characteristics mentioned in the description and their corresponding values, and transcribe them into JSON.
Your answer should be an array of JSON with name of the characteristic and the corresponding value formatted as follows: {"characteristic":(name of characteristic), "value":(value of characteristic)}.
(name of characteristic) should be substituted with the name of the characteristic, and (value of characteristic) should be substituted with the corresponding value.
The name of every characteristic must be written in lowercase.
Make sure that you surround your final answer with square brackets [ and ] so that it is a valid array.
Do not include any text (e.g. introductory text) other than the valid array of JSON.

Follow the instructions below.

1. Transcribe all the mentioned characteristics relating to the whole plant, such as growth form, reproduction, plant height, and branching.

2. Iterate through every mentioned organs (e.g. leaf and other leaf-like organs, stem, flower, inflorescence, fruit, seed and root) and parts of organs (e.g. stipule, anther, ovary) and transcribe their corresponding characteristics.
You must transcribe the length, width, shape, color, surface texture, surface features, and arrangement of each organ or part of an organ.
Each of these characteristics must be separate. The name of every characteristic relating to an organ or a part of an organ must be formatted as follows: "(name of organ or part of organ) (type of characteristic)", where (name of organ or part of organ) should be substituted with the name of the organ or part of the organ, and (type of characteristic) should be substituted with the specific type of characteristic.

In the final output JSON, try to include all words that appear in the given description, as long as they carry information about the plant species.
Do not make up characteristics that are not mentioned in the description.

Here are some examples of descriptions and their correponding transcription in JSON:

Sentence: "Fruit: ovoid berry, 10-12 mm wide, 13-15 mm long, yellow to yellow-green throughout."
JSON: {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "fruit type", "value": "berry"}, {"characteristic": "fruit width", "value": "10-12 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit length", "value": "13-15 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit color", "value": "yellow to yellow-green"}

Sentence: "Perennial dioecious herbs 60-100cm tall. Leaves alternate, green and glabrous adaxially and hirsute with white to greyish hair abaxially."
JSON: {"characteristic": "life history", "value": "perennial"}, {"characteristic": "reproduction", "value": "dioecious"}, {"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, , {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "60-100 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf arrangement", "value": "alternate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial colour", "value": "green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial texture", "value": "hirsute"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial hair colour", "value": "white to greyish"}

Include the following list of characteristics in your output. Use the name of the characteristic as given in this list. If you can't find one or more of these characteristics in the given description, put "NA" as the corresponding value. If you find a characteristic in the given description that is not in this list, add that characteristic in your response.

[CHARACTER_LIST]

Here is the description that you should transcribe:
