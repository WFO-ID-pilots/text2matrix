Buds ellipsoid, the corolla strongly exserted from the calyx tube before anthesis. Flowers all perfect, 5-merous. Calyx tube 2-2.5 mm long, cup-shaped, narrowing gradually to the pedicel, the lobes 2.5-3.5 mm long, the lower portion broadly deltate, the distal part an apiculate tip to 2 mm long, densely pubescent with simple uniseriate trichomes like those of the inflorescence rhachis, these apparently glandular, the adaxial surface glabrous.

Bark of older stems dark reddish brown, glabrescent.Sympodial units plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves simple or occasionally pinnately 2-3-lobed, (2.5-)6-15(-20) x (1.5-)3-9(-11) cm, elliptic to narrowly ovate, widest near the middle or in the basal third, coriaceous to chartaceous, the upper surfaces glabrous and somewhat shiny to pubescent with simple uniseriate trichomes along the veins to evenly pubescent on the veins and lamina with dendritic trichomes to 1 mm long, the lower surfaces glabrous (W Ecuador) to minutely simple puberulent to densely dendritic pubescent, the pubescence denser than that of the upper surfaces; primary veins 6-8 pairs, arching conspicuously to the petiole; base acute to truncate or cordate; margins entire or pinnatifid, the lobes to within 0.5 cm of the midrib; apex acute; petiole 1-6 cm, very variable in length along the stem, minutely puberulent to densely pubescent with dendritic trichomes like those of the stems and leaves, especially in the adaxial groove, twining.Inflorescence terminal or sometimes lateral, 4-20(-30+) cm, several times branched, the branches very variable in length, with up to 100 flowers, finely and densely puberulent with tiny simple trichomes to densely pubescent with dendritic trichomes; peduncle 1.5-6 cm, not particularly distinct; pedicels 0.5-1 cm, 0.5-1 mm in diameter at the base, 1.5-2 mm in diameter at the apex, stout, spreading at anthesis, minutely puberulent to densely pubescent like the rest of the inflorescence, the pubescence sparser distally, articulated at the base from a small sleeve leaving a tiny peg on the inflorescence axis; pedicel scars more or less evenly spaced 2-5 mm apart on the flowering parts of the inflorescence rhachis.
