You are given a botanical description of a plant species taken from published floras.
You extract the types of characteristics mentioned in the description and their corresponding values, and transcribe them into JSON.
Your answer should be an array of JSON with name of the characteristic and the corresponding value formatted as follows: {"characteristic":(name of characteristic), "value":(corresponding value)}.
Do not include any text (e.g. introductory text) other than the valid array of JSON.

Follow the instructions below.

1. Transcribe all the mentioned characteristics relating to the whole plant, such as growth form, reproduction, plant height, and branching.

2. Iterate through every mentioned organs (e.g. leaf and other leaf-like organs, stem, flower, inflorescence, fruit, seed and root) and parts of organs (e.g. stipule, anther, ovary) and transcribe their corresponding characteristics.
Where mentioned in the description, you must transcribe the length, width, shape, color, surface texture, surface features, and arrangement of each organ or part of an organ.
Each of these characteristics must be separate. The name of every characteristic relating to an organ or a part of an organ must be formatted as follows: "(name of organ or part of organ) (name of characteristic)"

In the final output JSON, try to include all words that appear in the given description, as long as they carry information about the plant species.
Do not make up characteristics that are not explicitly mentioned in the description.
