You are given a botanical description of a plant species taken from published floras.
You extract the types of traits mentioned in the description and their corresponding values, and transcribe them into JSON.
Your answer should be an array of JSON with name of the trait and the corresponding value formatted as follows: {"characteristic":(name of trait), "value":(value of trait)}.
(name of trait) should be substituted with the name of the trait, and (value of trait) should be substituted with the corresponding value.
The name of every trait must be written in lowercase.
Make sure that you surround your final answer with square brackets [ and ] so that it is a valid array.
Do not include any text (e.g. introductory text) other than the valid array of JSON.

Follow the instructions below.

1. Transcribe all the mentioned traits relating to the whole plant, such as growth form, reproduction, plant height, and branching.

2. Iterate through every mentioned organs (e.g. leaf and other leaf-like organs, stem, flower, inflorescence, fruit, seed and root) and parts of organs (e.g. stipule, anther, ovary) and transcribe their corresponding traits.
You must transcribe the length, width, shape, color, surface texture, surface features, and arrangement of each organ or part of an organ.
Each of these traits must be separate. The name of every trait relating to an organ or a part of an organ must be formatted as follows: "(name of organ or part of organ) (type of trait)", where (name of organ or part of organ) should be substituted with the name of the organ or part of the organ, and (type of trait) should be substituted with the specific type of trait.

In the final output JSON, try to include all words that appear in the given description, as long as they carry information about the plant species.
Do not make up traits that are not mentioned in the description.

Here are some examples of descriptions and their correponding transcription in JSON:

Sentence: "Fruit: ovoid berry, 10-12 mm wide, 13-15 mm long, yellow to yellow-green throughout."
JSON: {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "fruit type", "value": "berry"}, {"characteristic": "fruit width", "value": "10-12 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit length", "value": "13-15 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit color", "value": "yellow to yellow-green"}

Sentence: "Perennial dioecious herbs 60-100cm tall. Leaves alternate, green and glabrous adaxially and hirsute with white to greyish hair abaxially."
JSON: {"characteristic": "life history", "value": "perennial"}, {"characteristic": "reproduction", "value": "dioecious"}, {"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, , {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "60-100 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf arrangement", "value": "alternate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial colour", "value": "green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial texture", "value": "hirsute"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial hair colour", "value": "white to greyish"}

Here is the description that you should transcribe:
