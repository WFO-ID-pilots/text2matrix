Ovary glabrous; style 3-10 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 3-4 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma clavate to capitate.Fruit a globose berry, 1.5-1.8 cm in diameter, medium to deep green with purple stripes when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.", "char_json": [{"characteristic": "life history", "value": "herb"}, {"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "0.15-0.75 m"}, {"characteristic": "stem diameter", "value": "2-6 mm"}, {"characteristic": "stem characteristics", "value": "unwinged, glabrous, woody"}, {"characteristic": "leaf arrangement", "value": "odd-pinnate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf shape", "value": "ovate to elliptic"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial colour", "value": "dark green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial texture", "value": "coriaceous, glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial colour", "value": "light green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial texture", "value": "glabrous to glabrescent with very short hairs"}, {"characteristic": "terminal leaflet size", "value": "4-7.5 x 2-2.6 cm"}, {"characteristic": "terminal leaflet shape", "value": "ovate to elliptic"}, {"characteristic": "terminal leaflet apex", "value": "acute to acuminate"}, {"characteristic": "terminal leaflet base", "value": "attenuate; asymmetric with more tissue on the basiscopic side"}, {"characteristic": "interjected leaflets", "value": "0-14, sessile to short petiolulate"}, {"characteristic": "pseudostipule length", "value": "3-6 mm"}, {"characteristic": "pseudostipule texture", "value": "glabrous to subglabrous"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence length", "value": "5.5-11.5 cm"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence shape", "value": "forked"}, {"characteristic": "peduncle length", "value": "1.7-8.6 cm"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel length", "value": "25-35 mm"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel spacing", "value": "3-5 mm"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel articulation", "value": "high in the distal half"}, {"characteristic": "flower number", "value": "10-26"}, {"characteristic": "flower type", "value": "perfect"}, {"characteristic": "calyx length", "value": "3-10 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx shape", "value": "ovate to lanceolate"}, {"characteristic": "calyx texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "corolla diameter", "value": "3-4 cm"}, {"characteristic": "corolla shape", "value": "pentagonal to rotate"}, {"characteristic": "corolla colour", "value": "lilac to blue"}, {"characteristic": "corolla tube length", "value": "1-2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "corolla acumens length", "value": "0.8-2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "stamen filament length", "value": "1-2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "anther length", "value": "3-6 mm"}, {"characteristic": "anther shape", "value": "lanceolate"}, {"characteristic": "anther colour", "value": "yellow"}, {"characteristic": "ovary shape", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "style length", "value": "3-10 mm"}, {"characteristic": "style shape", "value": "straight"}, {"characteristic": "style texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "stigma shape", "value": "clavate to capitate"}, {"characteristic": "fruit type", "value": "globose berry"}, {"characteristic": "fruit size", "value": "1.5-1.8 cm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit colour", "value": "medium to deep green with purple stripes"}, {"characteristic": "seed shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "seed size", "value": "ca. 2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "seed colour", "value": "whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish"}, {"characteristic": "seed surface texture", "value": "mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout"}], "failed_str": null}]}
