Transcribe all the mentioned characteristics relating to the whole plant, such as growth form, reproduction, plant height, and branching.\n\n2. Iterate through every mentioned organs (e.g. leaf and other leaf-like organs, stem, flower, inflorescence, fruit, seed and root) and parts of organs (e.g. stipule, anther, ovary) and transcribe their corresponding characteristics.\nYou must transcribe the length, width, shape, color, surface texture, surface features, and arrangement of each organ or part of an organ.\nEach of these characteristics must be separate. The name of every characteristic relating to an organ or a part of an organ must be formatted as follows: \"(name of organ or part of organ) (type of characteristic)\", where (name of organ or part of organ) should be substituted with the name of the organ or part of the organ, and (type of characteristic) should be substituted with the specific type of characteristic.\n\nIn the final output JSON, try to include all words that appear in the given description, as long as they carry information about the plant species.\nDo not make up characteristics that are not mentioned in the description.\nChange any American spelling variants to their British counterparts where relevant.\nFor numeric characteristics, make sure that the dimensions are consistent. For example, for the characteristic \"leaf length\", \"11-15 cm\" can be a valid value but not \"11-15 x 12-13 cm\". Where possible, you should break down two-dimensional values into individual one-dimensional characteristics such as length and width. If you encounter such two-dimensional values with no indication of which value is the length or width, the word 'size' must be used in the name of the characteristic. For example, \"Fruits 10-12 x 13-15 mm\" may be transcribed as {\"characteristic\": \"fruit size\", \"value\": \"10-12 x 13-15 mm\"}.\nOnly have one entry for each distinct characteristic, without any duplicates.\n\nHere are some examples of descriptions and their correponding transcription in JSON:\n\nSentence: \"Fruit: ovoid berry, 10-12 mm wide, 13-15 mm long, yellow to yellow-green throughout.

Young stems densely pubescent with a mixture of stipitate to essentially sessile stellate trichomes, the multiseriate stalks of stipitate cauline stellae variable in length, the longest 0.3-2.5 (-4.5) mm, with lateral rays 6-10, 0.3-1 (-1.5) mm long, weakly ascending, the midpoints about equaling the rays in length, occasionally capitate-glandular; cauline prickles variable in size and density, but nearly always abundant, the largest 5-12 mm long, usually somewhat broad-based and laterally compressed.Sympodial units 2-foliate, geminate or not.Leaves simple, the blades 7-50 x 7-30 cm, ca. 1-2 times as long as wide, broadly elliptic or elliptic-ovate, thin-textured, pubescent adaxially with sessile stellae, the largest commonly with prominent midpoints 0.5-1.5 (-2.5) mm long and with 4-7 shorter, ascending lateral rays 0.3-0.8 mm long, the larger stellae grading into smaller ones, this transition sometimes abrupt and two distinct size classes of trichomes apparent, densely felty-pubescent abaxially with stalked and sessile stellae similar to those of the stem but the stalked ones on the average shorter, the foliar pubescence in vivo often with a purplish cast, especially along veins; usually prickly, with prickles similar to those of the stem but usually somewhat larger and often more broad-based, scattered along petiole, midrib and principal lateral veins; major lateral veins 4-6 on each side; base truncate to shallowly cordate, sometimes oblique; margin coarsely dentate with 3-5 (-7) deltoid or depressed-deltoid, acute-, obtuse-, or round-tipped lobes at lateral vein terminations, the interlobal sinuses entire or occasionally with 1 or 2 smaller tooth-like lobes; apex acute or obtuse; petioles ca. 3-15 cm, densely pubescent with hairs and prickles like those of the stem.Inflorescences 0.5-2.5 cm, extra-axillary or leaf-opposed, unbranched, with 5-20 flowers, the distal 1/3 female-sterile, the axes densely stellate-pubescent, usually minutely prickly; peduncle 0-1 cm; rachis 0-1.5 cm; pedicels 5-15 mm long in flower, 7-15 mm and thickened in fruit, spaced closely spaced 0-1 mm apart, articulated at the base.Flowers with the calyx broadly campanulate, the radius 8-15 mm, the tube 5-11 mm, the lobes 4-10 x 3-5 mm, broadly ovate or deltoid, densely felty-pubescent abaxially with stellate hairs, unarmed; fruiting calyx somewhat accrescent but not covering fruit. Corolla 2.5-4 cm in diameter, ca. 12-15 mm long, stellate, the tube 2-3 mm, thin-textured, white, the lobes 8-15 x 5-9 mm, ovate-lanceolate, spreading, stellate-pubescent abaxially, glabrous adaxially.
