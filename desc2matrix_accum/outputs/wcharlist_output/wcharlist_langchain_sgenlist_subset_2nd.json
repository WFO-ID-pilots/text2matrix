Corolla 2.5-5.5 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, violet to dark purple, often with a darker purple stripe in the middle of each lobe adaxially and abaxially, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 0.3-2.5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially, minutely puberulent abaxially, especially along the midribs, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 3-6 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 5-11 mm x 0.3-0.6 mm, exceeding stamens by 2.2-5 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma capitate.Fruit a conical berry, 1.4-2.2 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide, light green when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout;
