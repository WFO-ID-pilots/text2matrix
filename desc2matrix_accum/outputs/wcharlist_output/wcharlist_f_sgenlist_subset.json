Bark of older stems pale brownish yellow, glabrescent.Sympodial units plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves simple, 1.5-7(-11) x 0.9-3(-6) cm, elliptic to narrowly elliptic, membranous to slightly chartaceous or fleshy, discolorous, the upper surfaces shiny and sparsely and evenly pubescent with erect dendritic trichomes to 0.5 mm long, these with short and congested branches, occasionally glabrous with only a few trichomes along the midvein, the lower surfaces densely pubescent on veins and lamina with erect, golden, dendritic trichomes to 1 mm, with short, congested branches, the surface appearing golden; primary veins 7-10 pairs, paler than the lamina, golden beneath; base truncate to acute, occasionally oblique; margins entire, not markedly revolute; apex acute; petioles 0.5-2 (3.5) cm, densely golden pubescent with dendritic trichomes like those of the stems, occasionally twining to aid in climbing.Inflorescences terminal, occasionally becoming lateral and internodal, 5-10 cm long, globose in outline, many times branched, leafy near the basal branches, with 20-40 (+) flowers, densely pubescent with golden dendritic trichomes like those of the stems; peduncle very short, the transition between stem and inflorescence not always clear; pedicels 0.5-0.6 cm, stout or appearing so from dense pubescence, ca. 0.5 mm in diameter at the base, ca. 1 mm in diameter at the apex, spreading at anthesis, densely golden-pubescent with stiff dendritic trichomes to 1 mm long, articulated at the base leaving a small sleeve or peg 0.5-1 mm long on the axis; pedicel scars irregularly spaced 1-10 mm apart, obscured by the pubescence.Flowers all perfect 5-merous. Buds globose to broadly ellipsoid, the corolla strongly exserted from the calyx tube before anthesis. Calyx tube 2-2.5 mm, conical, the lobes 1.5-2 mm, deltate to narrowly deltate, the apex blunt, densely to sparsely pubescent with golden dendritic trichomes to 1 mm, the pubescence usually sparser than that of the pedicel. Corolla 1.5-1.7 cm in diameter, violet or purple to deep purple, stellate, lobed ca. 2/3 of the way to the base, the lobes 5-7 x 3.5-5.5 mm, planar at anthesis, glabrous adaxially, densely pubescent abaxially with a mixture of simple and dendritic trichomes to 0.5 mm, these weak and tangled, denser on the tips and margins, the interpetalar sinuses glabrous. Filament tube ca. 0.5 mm, the free portion of the filaments ca. 1 mm, glabrous; anthers 4-5 x 1.2-1.5 mm, glabrous, ellipsoid, loosely connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 7-8 mm long, glabrous or densely and minutely papillate in the basal 1.3; stigma capitate, minutely papillate.Fruit a globose berry, ca. 1 cm in diameter, purplish black and shiny when ripe, glabrous, the pericarp thin; fruiting pedicels 1-1.2 cm, ca. 1 mm in diameter at the base, woody and spreading, the calyx lobes woody and persistent around the base of the berry.Seeds 20-30 per berry, ca. 3 x 2.5-3 mm, flattened-reniform, the margins undulate, reddish brown, the testal surface minutely pitted, the cells pentagonal in outline.",

Trunks to 9 cm in diameter; bark of older stems pale brown; young branches terete, granular greenish-yellow tomentose, the hairs dendritic-echinoid and echinoid.Sympodial units plurifoliate, axillary leaves nearly always developed on young branches. Leaves simple, the blades usually 14-30 x 4-12 cm, obovate, ovate or broadly elliptic, rather thin, minutely scabrous adaxially, the hairs sessile or short-stalked, sparse, simple and porrect-stellate, porrect-stellate and multangulate-pubescent abaxially, the hairs sessile and short-stalked; base long-attenuate along nearly entire length of petiole; margin entire; apex obtuse, acute or short-acuminate; petioles minutely scabrous, the hairs sessile and short-stalked, porrect-stellate and multangulate.Inflorescences 7-14 cm, many times branched, sometimes with a pair of small bract-like leaves at the first dichotomy, granular tomentose, the hairs sessile and short-stalked, porrect-stellate, multangulate, echinoid and dendritic-echinoid; peduncle 3-8 cm, 2-4 mm thick; pedicels 3-7 mm in flower, closely spaced, articulated at the base.Buds 5-7 mm long, obovoid-oblong, tomentose, the hairs often appressed, mostly porrect-stellate and multangulate, the tomentum usually so dense as to obscure the calyx lobe sutures. Flowers all apparently perfect; calyx lobed 1/2-2/3 way to the base, the lobes 3-5 x 1.9-3.7 mm in flower, often uneven in size, acute, obtuse or semi-ovate, usually chartaceous, somewhat translucent, simple and stellate-pubescent adaxially; fruiting calyx somewhat accrescent, the lobes 3.9-6.5 x 1.8-4.5 mm. Corolla 1.5-2.1 cm in diameter, ca. 10-15 mm long, stellate, chartaceous, white, included in calyx until anthesis, with minute stellate hairs on the distal 1/2 adaxially. Stamens with filaments 1.1-1.5 mm, inserted on corolla tube 1.3-1.7 mm above base; anthers 2.9-4.4 mm long, oblong, blunt-tipped, yellow, free, poricidal at the tips, the pores large and directed distally and somewhat adaxially, lengthening to slits with age. Ovary conical, tomentose-pubescent; style tomentose-pubescent in the basal 3/4; stigma truncate to capitate.Fruit a fleshy berry, 1.1-1.4 cm in diameter, globose, obtuse at apex, green turning yellow when ripe, persistently pubescent.Seeds 2-2.8 x 1.5-2.1 mm, reniform, the testa minutely pitted.",

Stems up to 10 mm in diameter at base of plant, green to green mottled with purple, with straight narrow wings to 0.8 mm, usually glabrous; tubers typically placed one at the end of each stolon.Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 7-20 x 4-8.5 cm, chartaceous, glabrous to sparsely pubescent adaxially and abaxially, with hairs like those of the stems; lateral leaflet pairs 3-5, subequal or decreasing in size gradually toward the leaf base, with the terminal leaflet equal to or slightly larger than the laterals; most distal lateral leaflets 2-5.5 x 0.5-1.5 cm, ovate to elliptic-lanceolate, the apex slightly acuminate, the base with long petiolules 6-15 mm, symmetrical; terminal leaflet 4-6 x 1.5-2.5 cm, elliptic-lanceolate, the apex short acuminate, the base rounded or obtuse, with secondary leaflets on the petiolule absent; interjected leaflets 0-2, subsessile, ovate to orbicular; petioles 2-8 cm, glabrous. Pseudostipules minute to 5 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 5-10.5 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 10-14 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes glabrous; peduncle 4.5-6.5 cm long; pedicels 15-20 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated in the middle to the distal fourth.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 9-14 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 4-8 mm, long attenuate, the acumens 0.4-3 mm long, glabrous. Corolla 2-2.5 cm in diameter, rotate, pale violet, with an internal white star at the base of corolla adaxially, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens ca. 2.5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially, minutely puberulent abaxially, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers ca. 5 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 7-8 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 1.5-2 mm; stigma capitate.Fruit a long conical berry, 1-1.5 mm wide, 2-2.5 cm long, light green when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Stems 4-6 mm in diameter at base of plant, green mottled with purple, with straight narrow wings to 0.8 mm, sparsely pubescent; tubers typically borne singly at the end of each stolon.Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 14-22 x 7-11 cm, medium green, membranous to chartaceous, sparsely pubescent adaxially and abaxially; lateral leaflet pairs 3-5, subequal or decreasing in size gradually toward the leaf base, with the terminal leaflet equal to or slightly larger than the laterals; most distal lateral leaflets 4-9 x 1.3-2.5 cm, elliptic to lanceolate, the apex acuminate, the base with petiolules usually decurrent to subsessile or with petiolules 1-3 mm long, symmetrical; terminal leaflet 5.3-9 x 1.8-3 cm, elliptic to lanceolate, the apex long acuminate, the base round to obtuse, with secondary leaflets on the petiolule usually present; interjected leaflets 4-8, sessile, ovate to orbicular; petioles 2.5-4.5 cm, sparsely pubescent with hairs like those of the stem. Pseudostipules minute to 5 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 5-13.5 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 15-34 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes sparsely pubescent; peduncle 3.3-11 cm long; pedicels 13-28 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated between middle and the distal one-quarter.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 5-6 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 3-4 mm, long attenuate, the acumens 0.3-5 mm long, subglabrous to sparsely pubescent. Corolla 2.5-5.5 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, violet to dark purple, often with a darker purple stripe in the middle of each lobe adaxially and abaxially, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 0.3-2.5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially, minutely puberulent abaxially, especially along the midribs, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 3-6 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 5-11 mm x 0.3-0.6 mm, exceeding stamens by 2.2-5 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma capitate.Fruit a conical berry, 1.4-2.2 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide, light green when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Stems 1.5-12 mm in diameter at base of plant, unwinged or with wings up to 4 mm, green to purple or green and purple mottled, subglabrous to moderately to densely pubescent with short non-glandular hairs, sometimes glaucous; tubers typically borne singly at the end of each stolon.Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 3-35 cm long, 3-38 cm wide, light to dark green, membranous to chartaceous, sometimes tinged with purple, especially abaxially, or glaucous, glabrous to subglabrous to moderately to densely pubescent, often more densely pubescent abaxially; lateral leaflet pairs 2-6, with the pairs ranging greatly from subequal with the most distal lateral leaflets larger, to subequal; most distal lateral leaflets 1.2-36 cm long, 0.3-4.7 cm wide, lanceolate to elliptic to narrowly to broadly ovate, the apex acute to acuminate, the base symmetrical to oblique, truncate to cuneate, sometimes attenuate on the rachis, with petiolules absent if leaflets decurrent, or up to 7 mm long, sometimes bearing tertiary lateral leaflets; terminal leaflet subequal to slightly larger than the most distal lateral leaflets, 1.2-36 cm long, 1.5-3.0 cm wide, lanceolate to narrowly to broadly ovate to suborbicular, the apex acute to acuminate, the base symmetrical to oblique, truncate to cuneate at the base and therefore without petiolules, or with petiolules up to 10 mm long, sometimes bearing tertiary lateral leaflets; interjected leaflets 0-27, petioles 0.5-1.5 cm long, subglabrous to pubescent with hairs like those of the stem. Pseudostipules 10-26 mm long, lunate to scale-like, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 3-18 cm long, terminal with a subtending bud, generally borne in distal half of plant forked, with 3-20 flowers; peduncle 1.5-10 cm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; pedicels 5-30 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated at or somewhat distal to the middle, sometimes within 4 mm of the apex of the pedicel.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 4-10 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm long, the lobes 2-5 mm long, long attenuate to acute, the acumens 1-2.3 mm long, pubescent as the stem. Corolla 2.5-5 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate-pentagonal, purple violet to light blue, sometimes with a greenish-yellow to white to purple star, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 1-5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially, minutely puberulent abaxially, especially along the midveins, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 4-7 mm long, lanceolate, connate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 6-11 mm long, ca. 1 mm in diameter, exceeding stamens by 1.5-3.5 mm, straight to curved, glabrous; stigma capitate to clavate.Fruits globose to slightly ovoid, 1.5-3.3 cm long, 1.6-3.5 cm in diameter, green to green with scattered white dots, or whitish tinged with green, or green with purple stripes, usually glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Ovary with style 6-7 mm long, exceeding stamens by 2-2.5 mm, straight, with stigma globose.Fruits 0.8-1 cm in diameter, globose, light green throughout.Seeds from living specimens green-white throughout, ovoid, ca. 2 mm long, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet. Removal of these hair-like lateral walls by enzyme digestion reveals a honeycomb pattern at their base.",

Stems 3.5-10 mm in diameter at base of plant, green to purple or green and purple mottled, unwinged or with wings to 2 mm, glabrous to densely short pubescent; tubers typically borne singly at the end of each stolon.Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 10-39 x 6-24 cm, green, membranous to chartaceous, glabrous to densely short-pubescent adaxially and abaxially with hairs like those of the stems; lateral leaflet pairs 4-7, often subequal except for the most proximal 1 or 2 pairs that are greatly reduced in size; most distal lateral leaflets 2.7-9 x 0.9-3.5 cm, narrowly to broadly ovate to elliptic, the apex acute to acuminate, the base typically oblique, rounded to truncate, petiolules 0-5 mm long; terminal leaflet 4.1-9.4 x 0.9-4.3 cm, ovate to elliptic, the apex acute to acuminate, the base truncate to attenuate; interjected leaflets 0-20, sessile to short petiolulate, ovate to orbicular; petioles 1-4 cm, glabrous to densely short pubescent. Pseudostipules 3-20 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 2-15 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 8-25 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; peduncle 2.5-10.5 cm long; pedicels 12-23 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulation extremely variable from the proximal half to the distal third.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 3-5 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 1-4 mm, acute to long attenuate, the acumens 0.5-2 mm long, with hairs like those of the stem. Corolla 1.6-3.7 cm in diameter, deeply stellate to pentagonal, pure white to creamy yellow-white adaxially and abaxially, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 2-5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially, minutely puberulent abaxially, especially along the midribs, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 5-7 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 8-15 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 3-6 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma clavate to capitate.Fruit a globose to slightly ovoid berry, 1.5-2 cm in diameter, green to green with purple streaks when ripe, often with scattered white dots, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Stems 3-8 mm in diameter at base of plant, green, sometimes with purple spots, sometimes winged with very narrow wings 0-2.5 mm long, glabrous or glabrescent with short and acute hairs; tubers typically moniliform (multiple tubers arranged along the stolon like beads on a necklace).Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 4.9-31 x 4.4-29 cm, usually light green abaxially, sometimes with some light purple coloration, usually deep green adaxially, coriaceous and scabrous, usually glabrous to glabrescent with white short hairs adaxially, glabrous to glabrescent with short hairs abaxially; lateral leaflet pairs 1-4, usually decreasing in size toward the leaf base, with the terminal leaflet generally subequal to the laterals or slightly larger; most distal lateral leaflets 3.5-13.6 x 1.4-6.9 cm, ovate to elliptic, the apex acute to acuminate, the base petiolulate or sessile and attenuate to rounded, asymmetric with more tissue on the basiscopic side; terminal leaflet 2.1-15.3 x 2-9.4 cm, ovate to elliptic, the apex acute to acuminate, the base usually attenuate; interjected leaflets 0-2, sessile to short petiolulate, ovate to orbicular; petioles 0.4-5.1 cm, glabrous to glabrescent. Pseudostipules when present 1-10 mm long, glabrous to glabrescent.Inflorescences 4-12 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 10-60 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes glabrous or glabrescent with short white hairs; peduncle 2.2-12.9 cm long; pedicels 14-46 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 3-5 mm apart, articulated high in the distal half.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 5-13 mm long, the tube 3-6 mm, the lobes 5-14 mm, ovate to lanceolate, with acumens 1-7 mm long, usually glabrous. Corolla 2.1-4.3 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, white to purple, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 0-3 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, usually glabrous abaxially and adaxially. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 4-8 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 3-10 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 2-6 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma clavate to capitate.Fruits ovoid, 1.2-1.7 cm wide, 1.2-1.9 cm long, usually light green with deep green stripes when ripe, glabrous, occasionally scabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Inflorescences apparently lateral, 2-3 cm long, not branched, with 3-15 flowers, 1-4 flowers open at any one time, densely stellate-pubescent, with 0-15 prickles; peduncle 0-5 mm long; pedicels 0.7-1.5 cm long, erect, articulated at the base, densely stellate-pubescent, with 0-10 prickles; pedicel scars spaced 1-4 mm apart. Flowers 5-merous, apparently all perfect. Calyx 5-11 mm long, sparsely stellate-pubescent, with 0-40 prickles, the lobes 4-6.5 mm long, narrow-deltate, translucent membranous between the veins, apically acute to long-acuminate. Corolla 1.5-2.3 cm in diameter, mauve, stellate, lobed for ca. 2/3 of the way to the base, the lobes 4.5-8 mm long, 4-7 mm wide, deltate, reflexed, moderately stellate-pubescent abaxially, the trichomes porrect, sessile or stalked, the stalks to 0.1 mm, the rays 6-9, 0.15-0.25 mm long, the midpoints reduced or ca. same length as the rays. Stamens unequal, with the filament tube ca. 1.5 mm long, the free portion of four filaments 0.5-1.5 mm long; free portion of the fifth filament 1.8-2.5 mm long; anthers 4.5-6.5 mm long, connivent to spreading, oblong to tapering, poricidal at the tips. Ovary densely stellate-pubescent in the upper 1/3; style 0.6-0.9 cm long, gently curved, on the same side of the flower as the long stamen, densely stellate-pubescent in the lower 1/3. Fruit a spherical berry, 2-8 per infructescence, 0.7-1.3 cm in diameter, the pericarp smooth, evenly green when young, yellow at maturity, glabrous; fruiting pedicels 1-2(-2.8) cm long, 0.7-0.9(-1.5) mm in diameter at base, woody, pendulous, with 0-10 prickles; fruiting calyx accrescent and enclosing the mature berry, the lobes elongating to 10-20 mm long, extending 2-6 mm beyond the mature fruit, the calyx tissue brittle (in herbarium specimens) and tearing irregularly, with 25-100 prickles 3-10 mm long. Seeds ca. 10-25 per berry, 2.3-2.8 mm long, 1.7-2.5 mm wide, flattened-reniform, dark brown to almost black, shiny, the surface smooth, with fine raised outlines of cells or small pits.",

Pseudostipules absent to minute, auriculate, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 5-11 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 8-14 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; peduncle 7-8 cm long; pedicels 16-22 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, the articulation indistinct or only slightly distinct, articulated high in the distal half.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 6-8.5 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 4-7.5 mm, elliptic lanceolate lobes abruptly narrowed at apex to short pointed acumens, the acumens 2-3.5 mm long, with hairs like those of the stem. Corolla 3.5-5 cm in diameter, rotate, lilac-purple, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 1-3 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous abaxially, minutely puberulent adaxially, especially along the midribs, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 5-6 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 8-9.5 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 3-4 mm, straight, papillose in the distal half; stigma capitate.Fruit a globose to ovoid berry, 2-3 cm in diameter, green to green tinged with purple when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Leaves odd-pinnate, 3.5-20 cm long, 1.5-10 cm wide, finely to coarsely pubescent adaxially and abaxially; petioles 1.5-3 cm long; lateral leaflet pairs 2-4, the size of the lateral leaflets diminishing gradually towards the base of the leaf; most distal lateral leaflets 2-4 cm long, 1.2-2.5 cm wide, ovate to elliptical, apex obtuse to acute, base rounded to cuneate, sessile, generally decurrent on the rachis, sometimes subsessile with petiolules up to 2 mm long; terminal leaflet 3-6 cm long, 2-4 cm wide, ovate to elliptical, apex acute to obtuse, base rounded to cuneate; interjected 0-10.Inflorescence a dichasially branched, ebracteate, monochasial or dichasial cyme, 2-3 forked, generally in the distal half of the plant, with 5-10 flowers, all flowers perfect, peduncle 0.2-1.9 cm long; pedicels 3-15 mm long, articulate between the proximal \u00bc and the distal \u00bc.Flowers with the calyx 4.5-8 mm long, lobes acute, minute, acumens up to 1 mm long. Corollas 1.5-2.6 cm in diameter, rotate, acumens 1-2 mm long, edges of corolla flat, not folded dorsally, violet to violet-purple adaxially, uniform abaxially or lighter purple in the rays and interpetiolar tissue. Anthers 2-4.5 mm long, connate, yellow, apically poricidally dehiscent and often maturing to a short introrse apical slit, filaments 1-4 mm long. Ovary with style 5-6 mm long, exceeding stamens by 2 mm, straight, with stigma globose.Fruits 1-2.5 cm in diameter, globose to ovoid, light to medium green, sometimes with smooth white dots.Seeds from living specimens green-white throughout, ovoid, ca. 2 mm long, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet. Removal of these hair-like lateral walls by enzyme digestion reveals a honeycomb pattern at their base.",

Bark of older stems pale brown or pale reddish brown, glabrescent.Sympodial units plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves simple, 3-7(-11.5) x 1-3.5 cm, elliptic to narrowly elliptic, membranous, the upper surfaces glabrous with a few scattered dendritic trichomes along the veins to sparsely pubescent with loose dendritic trichomes to 0.5 mm, these occasionally mixed with a few simple uniseriate trichomes of the same size, the lower surfaces almost glabrous to densely pubescent with loose dendritic trichomes on the veins and lamina, usually also with sparse glandular papillae on the lamina; primary veins 8-9 pairs, usually reddish brown beneath; base attenuate to acute; margins entire, not revolute; apex acute to acuminate; petioles 0.5-2 cm, pubescent like the stems, in herbarium specimens usually drying darker and more pubescent adaxially, occasionally twining.Inflorescences terminal, 4-8 cm long, globose to depressed-elliptic in outline, many times branched, with 10-50 flowers, glabrous to pubescent with loose, dendritic trichomes like those of the stems; peduncle 0.3-1.2 cm, usually branching very near the base; pedicels 1-1.5 cm, slender, ca. 0.3 mm in diameter at the base, ca. 1 mm in diameter at the apex, glabrous to loosely pubescent with dendritic trichomes, spreading at anthesis, articulated at the base, leaving a swollen area on the axis; pedicel scars irregularly spaced 1-10 mm apart, the inflorescence rachis bent at the articulation points. Flowers apparently all perfect (although the type has no long-styled flowers), 5-merous. Buds ellipsoid, the corolla strongly exserted from the calyx tube in early bud. Calyx tube 1-2.5 mm, conical, the lobes 1-1.5 mm, deltate with thickened margins and an elongate apex, sparsely to densely pubescent with loose dendritic trichomes. Corolla (1.2)1.5-2.5 cm in diameter, white or white tinged with lilac, stellate, lobed ca. \u00be of the way to the base, the lobes 7-10 x 4-6 mm, planar at anthesis, densely papillate on the tips and margins, the papillae sometimes extending to the lobes abaxially. Filament tube minute, the free portion of the filaments 1-1.5 mm, glabrous or minutely pubescent with simple uniseriate trichomes less than 0.2 mm long; anthers ca. 4 x 1 mm, glabrous, ellipsoid, loosely connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 6-9 mm, minutely puberulent with tiny simple uniseriate trichomes, these denser in the basal half; stigma capitate, the surface minutely papillose.Fruit a globose berry, ca. 2 m in diameter, black when ripe, green when immature, dull and matte, glabrous, the pericarp thin; fruiting pedicels 1.5-2 cm, ca. 1 mm in diameter at the base tapering to an apical diameter of 1.5-2 mm, woody and somewhat deflexed.Seeds 10-12 per berry, ca. 5 x 4.5 mm, flattened-reniform, dark brown, the surfaces minutely pitted, the testal cells small and rectangular.",

Pseudostipules when present 5-9 mm long, densely pubescent like the leaves.Inflorescences 4-15.2 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, in distal half of the plant, forked, with 2-20 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with short white hairs; peduncle 1.1-8.4 cm long; pedicels 9-41 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 3-5 mm apart, articulated at the middle.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 4-7 mm long, the tube 1-3 mm, the lobes 3-4 mm, ovate to lanceolate, with acumens 0-3 mm long, densely pubescent with white short hairs. Corolla 2.4-4.8 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, usually deep purple, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 2-5 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, with white short hairs on the acumens. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 4-8 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 3-10 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 2-7 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma clavate to capitate.Fruit an ovoid to globose berry, 1.2-2.6 cm wide, 1.3-2.9 cm long, deep green, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Trunk leaves simple, unlobed or pinnately (2-)3-5-lobed; if unlobed, the blade elliptic-ovate, 22-35 x 12-21 cm, length:width ratio 1.5-2:1, the base cuneate, without basal lobes; if lobed, the blade 20-40 x 20-25 cm, divided about halfway to midrib, the sinuses rounded, obtuse, the base cuneate to shallowly cordate with basal lobes up to 2 cm long; petioles 10-20 cm long.  Crown leaves 4 per sympodial unit, simple, unlobed, the blade elliptic to ovate, 4-25 x 4-15 cm, length:width ratio 1-2:1, the base cuneate to truncate or deeply cordate, often oblique, with basal lobes up to 5 cm long; petioles 1-5 cm long, glabrous to densely puberulent, occasionally sparsely pilose with eglandular hairs 1-2 mm long.Inflorescence 10-50 cm, usually unbranched or forked, rarely further branched, with 20-40 (-100) flowers, all flowers perfect, the axes glabrous to densely puberulent, often also sparsely to moderately eglandular-pilose with hairs 1-2 mm long; peduncle 4-10 cm long; rachis 3-40 cm long; pedicels 20-35 mm long, 25-35 mm long in fruit, spaced (1-) 4-10 mm apart, articulated near the base, leaving pedicellar remnants up to 1 mm long. Buds narrowly oblong, obtuse at apex.  Flowers 5-merous, all perfect. Calyx fleshy, glabrous to densely puberulent, sometimes pilose at margin, the radius 3-5 mm, the lobes 1-2 x 2-3 mm, truncate, apiculate.  Corolla purple or whitish fading to green, fleshy or subcoriaceous, stellate, the radius 16-25 mm, the tube 1-2 mm long, the lobes 15-22 x 2-3 mm, narrowly oblong, glabrous to moderately puberulent abaxially, sparsely villous adaxially, the margin densely ciliate with hairs 1-2 mm long, the apex obtuse.  Anther thecae yellow or purplish, narrowly oblong to triangular, 8-10 mm long, 1-2 mm wide, the pores directed adaxially and distally; connective purple, narrowly oblong, 8-10 mm long, 1-2 mm wide, abaxially slightly shorter than thecae at apex, equal to or slightly exceeding them at base, adaxially present as a narrow swelling especially prominent toward base.  Ovary glabrous to densely puberulent; style cylindrical, glabrous or occasionally sparsely puberulent, strongly dilated distally, 9-12 mm long, 0.5-1 mm in diam., exserted 2-3 mm beyond stamens; stigma umbrella-shaped, concave with two apical protuberances, 2-3 mm in diameter.Fruits 4-5 cm long, 3-5 cm in diameter, ellipsoidal or globose, obtuse at apex, the color when ripe unknown, but probably yellow or whitish, glabrous to moderately puberulent, especially when young; mesocarp with stone cell aggregates.Seeds 5-6 mm long, 4-5 mm wide, rugose to sparsely puberulent, especially at margin.",

Leaves odd-pinnate, up to 35 cm long and 15 cm wide, glabrescent to more commonly moderately to densely glandular-pubescent, sometimes with both Type A and Type B glands adaxially and abaxially; petiolate, lateral leaflet pairs 4-6, subequal and somewhat decreasing in size from the middle to the apex and base, the basal pair usually the more reduced, light yellowish-green to gray-green; middle lateral leaflets 5-10 cm long, 1.5-4 cm wide, elliptic to lanceolate to narrowly ovate, apex acute to acuminate, base cuneate to obliquely rounded to obliquely cordate, sessile to petiolulate with petiolules up to 10 mm long, terminal leaflet nearly the same size and shape as the middle lateral leaflets or slightly wider and more ovate, interjected leaflets 1-8, to 2 cm long and 2 cm wide.Inflorescence a dichasially branched, ebracteate, monochasial or dichasial cyme, 2-3 forked, generally in the distal half of the plant, with 12-35 flowers, puberulent, all flowers perfect, peduncle 1-8 cm long; pedicels 6-20 mm long, typically articulate at the very base, but rarely slightly above the base.Flowers with the calyx 5-8 mm long, symmetrically 5-lobed at about the middle, lobes oblong, apiculate to caudate, acumens (0.5) 1-1.2 (2.8) mm long. Corollas 2.2-3.5 cm in diameter, rotate to rotate- pentagonal, usually homogeneously violet. Anthers 5-7 mm long, lanceolate, connate, yellow, apically poricidally dehiscent and often maturing to a short introrse apical slit, filaments 1-4 mm long. Ovary globose, with style 8-11 mm long, exceeding the stamens, straight, with stigma globose.Fruits 1.0-1.3 cm in diameter, globose, green to deep purple.Seeds from living specimens uniformly green-white externally, ovoid, ca 2 mm long, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet. Removal of these hair-like lateral walls by enzyme digestion reveals a honeycomb pattern at their base.",

Stems 3-5 mm in diameter at base of plant, green to green mottled with purple, with straight and narrow wings less than 0.8 mm wide, densely pubescent; tubers typically moniliform (multiple tubers arranged along the stolon like beads on a necklace).Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 5.5-14 x 2.5-10.5 cm, medium green, membranous to chartaceous, sparsely pubescent adaxially, densely pubescent abaxially; lateral leaflet pairs 1-3, subequal or the size of the leaflets decreasing gradually from the leaf base, with the terminal leaflet larger than laterals; most distal lateral leaflets 1.5-5.2 x 0.8-2.5 cm, ovate to elliptic, the apex slightly acuminate, the base sessile to subsessile, symmetrical to more commonly asymmetrical with more tissue on the basiscopic side; terminal leaflet 2.8-9 x 1.2-4.5 cm, ovate, the apex somewhat acuminate, the base attenuate, with secondary leaflets on the petiolule absent; interjected leaflets usually absent, rarely up to 4, sessile, ovate to orbicular; petioles 1-4.2 cm, densely pubescent with hairs like those of the stem. Pseudostipules minute to 10 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences 5-9.5 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 5-10 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes pubescent with hairs shorter than those of the stem; peduncle 1-5 cm long; pedicels 10-30 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated between the middle to the proximal \u00bc.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx 6-11 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes 3-7 mm, long attenuate, the acumens 0.7-3 mm long, pubescent with hairs like the stems. Corolla 2.2-2.9 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, light blue-violet to purple, the rays pale violet or white, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 1-3 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous adaxially and abaxially, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 3-4 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Style 5-6 mm x 0.4-0.5 mm, exceeding stamens by 1.5-3 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma capitate.Fruit a conical berry, 1.3-2.2 cm long, 1-1.8 cm wide, light green when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",

Stems 5-6 mm in diameter at base of plant, green, unwinged or with straight wings less than 0.5 mm wide, densely pubescent, tubers typically borne singly at the end of each stolon.Sympodial units tri- to plurifoliate, not geminate.Leaves odd-pinnate, the blades 13-14 x 5-6.5 cm, medium green, membranous to chartaceous, densely pubescent adaxially and less pubescent abaxially; lateral leaflet pairs 2-3, subequal or the leaflets decreasing gradually in size toward the leaf base, with the terminal leaflet larger than the laterals; most distal lateral leaflets 2.6-3.8 x 1.2-2.2 cm, ovate to elliptic, the apex slightly acuminate, the base sessile to subsessile, symmetrical; terminal leaflet 4.5-7 x 2.2-3.7 cm, elliptic to ovate, the apex slightly acuminate, the base round or obtuse, with secondary leaflets on the petiolule absent; interjected leaflets absent; petioles 2.5-4 cm, densely pubescent with hairs like those of the stems. Pseudostipules minute to 5 mm long, pubescent with hairs like those of the stem.Inflorescences ca. 7.5 cm, terminal with a subtending axillary bud, generally in distal half of the plant, usually forked, with 2-12 flowers, with all flowers apparently perfect, the axes densely pubescent with hairs like those of the stem; peduncle 2-5.4 cm long; pedicels 12-22 mm long in flower and fruit, spaced 1-10 mm apart, articulated in the proximal third.Flowers homostylous, 5-merous. Calyx ca. 5 mm long, the tube 1-2 mm, the lobes ca. 2 mm, long attenuate, the acumens 1-3 mm long, densely pubescent. Corolla 2.2-2.6 cm in diameter, pentagonal to rotate, purple, the rays white, the tube 1-2 mm long, the acumens 2-3 mm long, the corolla edges flat, not folded dorsally, glabrous abaxially and adaxially?, ciliate at the margins, especially at the tips of the corollas. Stamens with the filaments 1-2 mm long; anthers 4-5 mm long, lanceolate, connivent, yellow, poricidal at the tips, the pores lengthening to slits with age. Ovary glabrous; style 7-8 mm x 0.4-0.5 mm, exceeding stamens by 2.5-3 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma capitate.Fruit a conical berry, 1.8-2.2 cm long, 1-1.3 cm wide, light green when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.",
