{"sys_prompt": "\nYou are a diligent robot assistant made by a botanist. You have expert knowledge of botanical terminology.\nYour goal is to transcribe the given botanical description of plant characteristics into a valid JSON output.\nYour answer must be as complete and accurate as possible.\nYou must answer in valid JSON, with no other text.\n", "prompt": "You are given a botanical description of a plant species taken from published floras.\nYou extract the types of characteristics mentioned in the description and their corresponding values, and transcribe them into JSON.\nYour answer should be an array of JSON with name of the characteristic and the corresponding value formatted as follows: {\"characteristic\":(name of characteristic), \"value\":(value of characteristic)}.\n(name of characteristic) should be substituted with the name of the characteristic, and (value of characteristic) should be substituted with the corresponding value.\nThe name of every characteristic must be written in lowercase.\nMake sure that you surround your final answer with square brackets [ and ] so that it is a valid array.\nDo not include any text (e.g. introductory text) other than the valid array of JSON.\n\nFollow the instructions below.\n\n1. Transcribe all the mentioned characteristics relating to the whole plant, such as growth form, reproduction, plant height, and branching.\n\n2. Iterate through every mentioned organs (e.g. leaf and other leaf-like organs, stem, flower, inflorescence, fruit, seed and root) and parts of organs (e.g. stipule, anther, ovary) and transcribe their corresponding characteristics.\nYou must transcribe the length, width, shape, color, surface texture, surface features, and arrangement of each organ or part of an organ.\nEach of these characteristics must be separate. The name of every characteristic relating to an organ or a part of an organ must be formatted as follows: \"(name of organ or part of organ) (type of characteristic)\", where (name of organ or part of organ) should be substituted with the name of the organ or part of the organ, and (type of characteristic) should be substituted with the specific type of characteristic.\n\nIn the final output JSON, try to include all words that appear in the given description, as long as they carry information about the plant species.\nDo not make up characteristics that are not mentioned in the description.\nChange any American spelling variants to their British counterparts where relevant.\nFor numeric characteristics, make sure that the dimensions are consistent. For example, for the characteristic \"leaf length\", \"11-15 cm\" can be a valid value but not \"11-15 x 12-13 cm\". Where possible, you should break down two-dimensional values into individual one-dimensional characteristics such as length and width. If you encounter such two-dimensional values with no indication of which value is the length or width, the word 'size' must be used in the name of the characteristic. For example, \"Fruits 10-12 x 13-15 mm\" may be transcribed as {\"characteristic\": \"fruit size\", \"value\": \"10-12 x 13-15 mm\"}.\nOnly have one entry for each distinct characteristic, without any duplicates.\n\nHere are some examples of descriptions and their correponding transcription in JSON:\n\nSentence: \"Fruit: ovoid berry, 10-12 mm wide, 13-15 mm long, yellow to yellow-green throughout.
