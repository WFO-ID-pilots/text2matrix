Ovary glabrous or stellate-pubescent in the upper 1/5; style 0.45-0.9 cm long, slender to stout, straight to recurved, glabrous to stellate-pubescent for up to 2/3 of its length.Fruit a berry, usually spherical but with cultivars of various shapes, 1-4 per infructescence, (1-)1.5-2.5(-5) cm in diameter, the pericarp smooth, dark green with pale green and cream markings when young, orange at maturity, glabrous; fruiting pedicels 0.7-2.5 cm long, 0.5-1.5 mm in diameter at base, woody, erect to pendulous; fruiting calyx lobes elongating to 3.5-17 mm long, 1/4-1/2 the length of the mature fruit, reflexed.Seeds ca. 20-100 per berry, 2.1-3.5 mm long, 2-2.5 mm wide, flattened-reniform, dull yellow to orange-brown.", "char_json": [{"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "0.3-1 m"}, {"characteristic": "young stem and leaf texture", "value": "glabrous to moderately stellate-pubescent"}, {"characteristic": "new growth appearance", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "stem texture", "value": "glabrous to moderately stellate-pubescent"}, {"characteristic": "stem wing width", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "bark texture", "value": "glabrous, sometimes glabrescent"}, {"characteristic": "leaf shape", "value": "ovate, sometimes elliptic"}, {"characteristic": "leaf width", "value": "2.5-10 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf length", "value": "5-18 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf lateral vein arrangement", "value": "3-6 pairs"}, {"characteristic": "leaf apex shape", "value": "acute"}, {"characteristic": "leaf base shape", "value": "cuneate to rounded"}, {"characteristic": "petiole length", "value": "1-4 cm"}, {"characteristic": "petiole wing width", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf size", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf apex shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf base shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "minor leaf petiole length", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence arrangement", "value": "lateral"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence length", "value": "1-1.8 cm"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence flower number", "value": "1-2(-10)"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence texture", "value": "glabrous to moderately stellate-pubescent"}, {"characteristic": "bud shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "bud calyx shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel length", "value": "0.5-2 cm"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel texture", "value": "glabrous to moderately stellate-pubescent"}, {"characteristic": "pedicel narrowing", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "flower calyx tube shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "flower calyx tube length", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "flower calyx tube texture", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "flower lobe shape", "value": "deltate, spreading"}, {"characteristic": "flower lobe length", "value": "2.5-8 mm"}, {"characteristic": "flower lobe margin", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "corolla shape", "value": "lobed for ca. 2/3 of the way to the base"}, {"characteristic": "corolla diameter", "value": "0.8-1.8 cm"}, {"characteristic": "corolla tube length", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "anther shape", "value": "tapering, poricidal at the tips"}, {"characteristic": "anther tip shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "anther connection", "value": "connivent to spreading"}, {"characteristic": "filament length", "value": "0.4-0.8 mm"}, {"characteristic": "filament tube length", "value": "1.5 mm"}, {"characteristic": "ovary texture", "value": "glabrous or stellate-pubescent in the upper 1/5"}, {"characteristic": "ovary papilla shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "style length", "value": "0.45-0.9 cm"}, {"characteristic": "stigma shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "seed shape", "value": "flattened-reniform"}, {"characteristic": "seed surface texture", "value": "dull yellow to orange-brown"}, {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "spherical"}, {"characteristic": "fruit type", "value": "berry"}, {"characteristic": "fruit width", "value": "1-4 cm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit length", "value": "1-4 cm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit colour", "value": "dark green with pale green and cream markings when young, orange at maturity"}], "failed_str": null}]}
