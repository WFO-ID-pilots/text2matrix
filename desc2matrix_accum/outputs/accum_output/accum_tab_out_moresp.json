Ovary glabrous; style 3-10 mm x ca. 1 mm, exceeding stamens by 2-7 mm, straight, glabrous; stigma clavate to capitate.Fruit an ovoid to conical berry, ca. 1.5 cm wide, 3.5-4 cm long, deep green, sometimes with deep green or purple stripes or white dots when ripe, glabrous.Seeds from living specimens ovoid and ca. 2 mm long, whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish, with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells that make the seeds mucilaginous when wet, green-white throughout; testal cells honeycomb-shaped when lateral walls removed by enzyme digestion.", "char_json": [{"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, {"characteristic": "life history", "value": "perennial"}, {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "0.19-0.75 m"}, {"characteristic": "stem diameter", "value": "0.3-1.2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "stem pubescence", "value": "densely pubescent with long hyaline hairs"}, {"characteristic": "leaf shape", "value": "odd-pinnate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf size", "value": "9-22 x 5.9-12.2 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial color", "value": "deep green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial color", "value": "light green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf texture", "value": "densely pubescent with long hyaline hairs"}, {"characteristic": "petiole length", "value": "1.8-3.5 cm"}, {"characteristic": "petiole diameter", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "petiole texture", "value": "densely pubescent with long hyaline hairs"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence shape", "value": "forked"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence length", "value": "9-15 cm"}, {"characteristic": "inflorescence branching", "value": "9-35 flowers"}, {"characteristic": "reproduction", "value": "perfect"}, {"characteristic": "calyx length", "value": "3-11 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx tube length", "value": "1-3 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx lobes length", "value": "3-10 mm"}, {"characteristic": "calyx lobes tips", "value": "5-10 mm long"}, {"characteristic": "calyx pubescence", "value": "pubescent with hyaline short hairs"}, {"characteristic": "corolla diameter", "value": "3-5.2 cm"}, {"characteristic": "corolla shape", "value": "pentagonal to rotate"}, {"characteristic": "corolla color", "value": "white"}, {"characteristic": "corolla lobes shape", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "corolla lobes midrib", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "corolla pubescence", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "stamen filament length", "value": "1-2 mm"}, {"characteristic": "anther length", "value": "5-8 mm"}, {"characteristic": "anther color", "value": "yellow"}, {"characteristic": "ovary texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "style length", "value": "3-10 mm"}, {"characteristic": "style diameter", "value": "ca. 1 mm"}, {"characteristic": "style texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "stigma diameter", "value": "NA"}, {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "ovoid to conical"}, {"characteristic": "fruit size", "value": "ca. 1.5 cm wide, 3.5-4 cm long"}, {"characteristic": "fruit color", "value": "deep green, sometimes with deep green or purple stripes or white dots"}, {"characteristic": "seed shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "seed size", "value": "ca. 2 mm long"}, {"characteristic": "seed color", "value": "whitish to greenish in fresh condition and drying brownish"}, {"characteristic": "seed surface", "value": "with a thick covering of \u201chair-like\u201d lateral walls of the testal cells"}], "failed_str": null}]}
