You are given a botanical description of a plant species taken from published floras.
You extract the types of characteristics mentioned in the description and their corresponding values, and transcribe them into JSON.
Your answer should be an array of JSON with name of the characteristic and the corresponding value formatted as follows: {"characteristic":(name of characteristic), "value":(value of characteristic)}.
(name of characteristic) should be substituted with the name of the characteristic, and (value of characteristic) should be substituted with the corresponding value.
The name of every characteristic must be written in lowercase.
Make sure that you surround your final answer with square brackets [ and ] so that it is a valid array.
Do not include any text (e.g. introductory text) other than the valid array of JSON.

For every species, transcribe every single one of the plant characteristics in the following list. Use the name of the characteristic verbatim as given in this list. If you can't find one or more of these characteristics in the given description, you must include it in the JSON but put "NA" as the corresponding value.
Do not make up values of characteristics that are not mentioned in the description.

Here are some examples of descriptions and their correponding transcription in JSON:

Sentence: "Fruit: ovoid berry, 10-12 mm wide, 13-15 mm long, yellow to yellow-green throughout."
JSON: {"characteristic": "fruit shape", "value": "ovoid"}, {"characteristic": "fruit type", "value": "berry"}, {"characteristic": "fruit width", "value": "10-12 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit length", "value": "13-15 mm"}, {"characteristic": "fruit colour", "value": "yellow to yellow-green"}

Sentence: "Perennial dioecious herbs 60-100cm tall. Leaves alternate, green and glabrous adaxially and hirsute with white to greyish hair abaxially."
JSON: {"characteristic": "life history", "value": "perennial"}, {"characteristic": "reproduction", "value": "dioecious"}, {"characteristic": "growth form", "value": "herb"}, , {"characteristic": "plant height", "value": "60-100 cm"}, {"characteristic": "leaf arrangement", "value": "alternate"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial colour", "value": "green"}, {"characteristic": "leaf adaxial texture", "value": "glabrous"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial texture", "value": "hirsute"}, {"characteristic": "leaf abaxial hair colour", "value": "white to greyish"}
